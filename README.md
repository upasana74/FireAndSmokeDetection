# FireAndSmokeDetection
Used TensorFlow models EfficientNet, Resnet and MobileNet models which are custom-trained to detect Fire and Smoke.

Dataset used: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Fqc-fMOy6u5Z4o_HVPLYlncJw3GtAvRr?usp=sharing

  Step 1: Use tf_classifier.ipynb for training the dataset. Alternatively you can use the following kaggle notebook for training the custom model: https://www.kaggle.com/upasana77/fire-smoke-neutral-detection-tf-training.

  Step 2: Retrieve the .h5 model and download it.
  
  Step 3: Use the .h5 model in tf_inference.ipynb to get results.
